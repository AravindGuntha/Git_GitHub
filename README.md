# This repository contains the information regarding Git and GIT Hub

<p>GIT is a <h1>version control tool</h1> </p>
<p> Version in this context meaning, A newly changed file.<br>
To elaborate, let's take a XYZ File which contains a N-number of lines in it.<br>
And, adding a few lines/changing a few lines in it, would make a new File, and this is called a new VERSION of the XYZ File.<br><br><br>
So, now what does Contolling mean ? <br>
let it be any platform, Remote site/ Local Desktop, once a file in it is being updated, at any given point of time, we cannot retrieve the old version of the file(s). <br>
so, Controlling here means, to have a control on all the versions. How many ever changes we have made to a files, that many versions of the same file will be there.<br>
</p>
<br>
<ht>What is the benefit of holding different versions of the same file ??</h4>
<p>
1. it helps to revert back to any of the previous versions easily.<br>
2. it also allows multiple users to connect and work on the same file <br>
3. it also has something called as branches, which allows multiple teams to take a certain copy and work on different things in a different branch. <br>
